Nearest Neighbor Analysis - Geo Spatial Data Analysis -- How to find the nearest neighbour of spatial data in Python
Performed Nearest Neighbourhood Analysis with Bike Sharing dataset from Chicago City utilizing GeoPandas & Shapely
The dataset consists of two separate files. The first one is bike stations and the second is randomly generated points.
We want to determine which station is near to any given point in the second dataset â€” the randomly generated points.
To perform any Geographic processing task, including the Nearest Neighbour Analysis for this tutorial, we need to convert the data into a Geodataframe using Geopandas.
Visualise the data in a map using Folium Python Library.
